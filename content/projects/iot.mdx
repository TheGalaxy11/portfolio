The CuriDosa System is suitable for a variety of applications, including residential homes, offices, and small businesses. Its seamless integration of IoT technology and user-friendly customization options make it a versatile and effective solution for enhancing security and peace of mind.

###### IoT Connectivity 
The CuriDosa System is equipped with IoT capabilities, allowing users to remotely monitor and control the security system through a Blynk app. 
This feature enhances convenience and accessibility, providing real-time updates on the security status.

###### Event Logging
The system maintains a detailed event log, recording all instances of triggered alarms and system activities. 
This log can be accessed remotely, providing users with a comprehensive history of security-related events.
