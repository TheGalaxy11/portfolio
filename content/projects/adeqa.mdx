Embarking on a solo journey as a dedicated Full Stack Developer, to create the ADEQA project,which aims to make External Quality Assessment 
(EQA) programs accepted around the world as invaluable tools used by laboratories to periodically 
assess their analytical performance and achieve added confidence in reporting their patient test results.

####Laravel-Powered Backend:
Leveraging the versatility of Laravel, I engineered a secure and scalable backend that ensures the seamless functioning of ADEQA. 
The MVC architecture enhances maintainability and sets the foundation for future enhancements.
