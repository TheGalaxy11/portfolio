This project is a facial recognition system that can identify the age and gender of individuals in images or videos using deep learning techniques.


###### Face Detection: 
Implement a face detection algorithm using OpenCV to locate and extract facial regions within an image or video stream. 
The detection phase is crucial for isolating faces and preparing them for subsequent analysis.

###### Age Prediction:
Utilize pre-trained deep learning models for age estimation. Train or fine-tune models on datasets that include facial images labeled with age information. 
Implement algorithms to predict the age range of individuals based on their facial features.

###### Gender Prediction:
Employ pre-trained models for gender classification. 
Train or fine-tune models on datasets with labeled gender information. 
Implement algorithms to predict the gender of individuals based on facial characteristics.
